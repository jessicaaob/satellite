The 4th is a near-infrared band. We are using the smaller test set because the training set is too big.\n","After extracting the data from the csv files, we can reshape it into the original images. Then, we can see the images before we train on them.\n","The second file we are loading are the labels for each image. They can be one of 4: barren land, trees, grassland and other. Each row in the file looks like this [1,0,0,0], where only one of the 4 value is 1. If it is one, then it is that class respective to the order I showed above.
